  Hi there! I'm Josh. Currently a first year Game Design Student.
  
I've been gaming for as long as I can remember. Around 12 I started tinkering and messing with computers. One day I stumbled upon GNU/Linux and became completely obssessed. It opened up a world I never knew existed. Software, hardware and ethics are things I'm really passionate about. My dream is to eventually delve into DevOps down the line, but for now I plan on creating unique experiences for people to enjoy through gaming. 
  
  (coming soon)<a href='in development'> My website </a>
<br>
<br>
My current goals are learning C#, CSS, HTML and Bash scripting.
During my free time I enjoy going on adventures, watching series, listening to rap and edm and occasionally playing some games.
